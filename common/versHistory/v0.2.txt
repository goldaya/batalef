Channel calls gui:
 - remove call in all channels
 - display envelope in dB
 - process/display modes
 - checkboxes and radiobuttons for process type
 - sliders dB is 20log10 instead of 10log10
 - filter: can now use butterworth filter on call window
 - ridge: added "Basic, peak outwards" ridge function

pieacewise peak detection
 - fixed bugs which blocked pwpd

v0.2.1
 - fixed bug with filter on peak detection which happened due to v0.2

v0.2.2
 - fixed bug with spectrum computation on very short calls

v0.2.3
 - Changed the channel calls matching algo to simply check each channel against the base channel alone.
 - in the flight path & beam gui added "select all", "compute beam" buttons
 - in calls gui set the deafult mode to display mode and all checkboxes marked

v0.2.4
 - spectrograms are now displayed using the "imagesc" function
 - in spectrogram gui, channel calls are now displayed only with call number, and no "*"
 - "keep parameters" menu item in calls-gui now opens a save file dialog 
   (parameters are kept in global structures before the dialog, so aborting does not affect the keep command)
 - fixed bug in flight&beam where window was cut in half.
 - in calls gui, now applying filter to the whole channel (and keeping the TS - filtered or unfiltered - in
   the control global) and slicing the call TS when needed.
 - colors in raw beam data are now paired with those of the interpolated beam
 - mic columns in the flight & beam gui table
