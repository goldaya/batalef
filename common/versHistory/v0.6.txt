Background processing
 - Specifically for Edward: only peak detection and FE for features

v0.6.1 - bugs:
 - in localization, the times were taken from the 'features' data instead
   of the 'forLocalization' data
 - filter in the FE gui: the envelope was shown pre-filtered

v0.6.2 - background processing (edward)
v0.6.3 - single shot secondary files creation
